Price volatility plays a pivotal role not only in derivative pricing but also risk management. Hence, it is not only important to measure volatility but also to predict it from sample data. Andersen et al. have demonstrated that under certain conditions the realized volatility estimator is an unbiased and highly efficient estimator of volatility. Here, we propose to combine the realized volatility estimator with the zero-intelligent agent order-flow model developed by E. Smith \& J.D. Farmer (Quantitative finance 3.6 (2003): 481-514) to investigate the predictive power of the model implied realized volatility. To this end we will calibrate the order flow model to $3$ different sets of high-frequency data covering small and large spreads (Oracle, Tesla and Netflix) and estimate the volatility from the simulated price paths. In order to access the predictive performance, we will compare the  model generated volatility with the real one. Due to the simplicity of the model, we expect that it will not perfectly capture the real volatility, hence, we plan to improve the model in regard to its predictive power of volatility.
